Hello and welcome to Butterfly Knife Fight! Currently this game is still in the development stage, but we've decided to let people check it out, contribute, and play as we go through the development process. This way, we can get early feedback and pivot or change things before we get too invested in them.

## About Us

This started as a group project a few of us were building for Demo Night at Make School last year. In all the chaos after that event, development on the game ceased for quite a while.

Recently, I have picked it back up and started sorting through some of the bugs we encountered back then in an effort to push the project through to full release, or at the very least a version that I can utilize to get feedback and continue development. To that end, I 100% appreciate any and all feedback, suggestions, and help that anyone wants to offer towards the project.
